POLICY_FILENAME
   Sets where the policy file is located

POLICY_ENFORCE_AUTHENTICATION
   Require that senders who use a local name for envelope
   authenticate.  This is the recommended setting.

POLICY_DEALLOCATE
   For every MAIL FROM, RCPT TO combination, re-read all
   policy information.  This makes policies more dynamic,
   and stops remote users from causing lots of memory usage,
   however, it also increases disk i/o, and slows down
   policy enforcement.  If this is not defined, domain policies
   will stay in memory until the SMTP session is ended.
