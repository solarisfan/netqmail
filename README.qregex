QREGEX (v2) 20060423 - README April 23, 2006
A Regular Expression matching patch for qmail 1.03 and netqmail


OVERVIEW:

qregex adds the ability to match address evelopes via Regular Expressions (REs)
in the qmail-smtpd process. It has the abiltiy to match `helo/ehlo` (host name),
`mail from` (envelope sender), and `rcpt to` (envelope recipient) commands.
It follows all the base rules that are set out with qmail (ie using control
files) so it makes for easy integretion into an existing setup (see the
install instructions for more info). The v2 is specified because qregex was
re-written to better conform to the security guarantee set forth by the author
of qmail. The original version used stdio.h and stdlib.h for reading the
control files whereas v2 now uses all stralloc functions which are much more
regulated against buffer overruns and the like.
See: http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html


FEATURES:

Features of qregex include:

1. Performs pattern matching on envelope senders and envelope
   recipients against REs in the badmailfrom and badmailto control
   files. Two additional control files, badmailfromnorelay and
   badmailtonorelay, are used for pattern matching when the 
   RELAYCLIENT environment variable is not set.

2. Performs pattern matching on the helo/ehlo host name. Setting the
   NOBADHELO environment variable prevents the host name from being
   compared to the patterns in the badhelo control file.

3. Matches to patterns are logged. Setting the LOGREGEX environment
   variable causes the matched regex pattern to be included in the log. 

4. Matching is case insensitive.

5. qregex ignores empty envelope senders. An empty envelope sender is not
   compared to the patterns in the badmailfrom and badmailfromnorelay
   control files and is always accepted.


PLATFORMS:

qregex has been built and tested on the following platforms. I'm sure it won't
have any problems on any platform that qmail will run on (providing they have
a regex interface) but if you run into problems let me know.

	- OpenBSD 3.x
	- FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x
	- Mandrake Linux 9.x
	- SuSE Linux 8.x



INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Installation is very simple, there is only one requirement. You need to use the
GNU version of the patch utility (http://www.gnu.org/software/patch/patch.html).
(For Solaris 8 users it is installed as 'gpatch')

- If this is a new setup.
Unpack the qmail archive, cd into the qmail-1.03 directory and run
"patch < /path/to/qregex-<version>.patch". Follow the instructions as per the
included qmail INSTALL file. Once you are done come back to this file and read
the section on the control files.

If you are using netqmail, then unpack the netqmail archive. Run the collate.sh
script and cd into the resulting netqmail-<version> directory. From there, run
"patch < /path/to/qregex-<version>.patch". Complete the netqmail installation
normally. Once you are done, come back to this file and read the section on the
control files.

- If this is an existing setup.
FIRST: create your control files (see below).
cd into your existing qmail or netqmail source directory. Run
"patch < /path/to/qregex-<version>.patch" then "make qmail-smtpd". Now run
./qmail-smtpd and test your new rules to make sure they work as expected.

Install the new binary by cd'ing to /var/qmail/bin and as root (in one command)
copy the existing binary to 'qmail-smtpd.old' and copy the new binary from the
source directory to 'qmail-smtpd'.
(ex. cp qmail-smtpd qmail-smtpd.old && cp ~/qmail-1.03/qmail-smtpd qmail-smtpd)

You can also optionally just run "make setup check" as it will install the
updated documentation and man pages provided with this patch. Stopping qmail
before doing the "make setup check" is always a good idea.


LOGGING:

qregex will log matches to the patterns in the various control files. Log
messages will take these three forms depending on which control file was
matched:

badhelo
qmail-smtpd: badhelo: <host> at <remote IP>

badmailfrom and badmailfromnorelay
qmail-smtpd: badmailfrom: <sender address> at <remote IP>

badmailto and badmailtonorelay
qmail-smtpd: badmailto: <rcpt address> at <remote IP>

When the LOGREGEX environment variable is set, the matched pattern will
be included in the log. Log messages will have the regex pattern appended
to them. For example, a badhelo log message will look like this:

qmail-smtpd: badhelo: <host> at <remote IP> matches pattern: <regex>


CONTROL FILES:

qregex provides you with five control files. None of these control files
is mandatory and you can use them in any combination you choose in your setup.

The "control/badmailfrom" and "control/badmailto" files contain your REs for
matching against the 'mail from' (envelope sender) and 'rcpt to' (envelope
recipient) smtp commands respectively.
The "control/badmailfromnorelay" and "control/badmailtonorelay" match against
the same commands but are read only when the RELAYCLIENT environment variable
is not set.
The "control/badhelo" file matches against the 'helo/ehlo' smtp command.

If you prefer you can symlink the badmailfrom and badmailto control files
(ln -s badmailfrom badmailto) and maintain fewer sets of rules. Beware
this might cause problems in certain setups.
        
	Here's an example "badhelo" file.
	-----------------------------------
	# block host strings with no dot (not a FQDN)
	!\.
	-----------------------------------
	
	An example "badmailfrom" file.
	-----------------------------------
	# this will drop everything containing the string
	# bad.domain.com or Bad.Domain.Com or BAD.domain.COM
	bad\.domain\.com
	# force users to fully qualify themselves
	# (i.e. deny "user", accept "user@domain")
	!@
	-----------------------------------

	And "badmailto" (a little more interesting)
	-----------------------------------
	# must not contain invalid characters, brakets or multiple @'s
	[!%#:*^(){}]
	@.*@
	-----------------------------------

You can use the non-RE character '!' to start an RE as a signal to qregex to
negate the action. As used above in the badmailfrom file, by negating the '@'
symbol qregex will signal qmail-smtpd to deny the 'mail from' command whenever
the address doesn't contain an @ symbol. When used inside a bracket expression,
the '!' character looses this special meaning. This is shown in the badmailto
example.

The norelay control files follow the same rules as the other control files but
are intended to address two specific scenarios.
The badmailfromnorelay file can be used to block mail trying to spoof a domain
hosted on your mail server. It prevents a mail client that is not allowed to
relay email through your server from using one of your hosted domains as its
envelope sender.
The badmailtonorelay file can be used to create email addresses that cannot
receive mail from any source not allowed to relay email through your server.
This is handy for creating email addresses for use only within your own 
domain(s) that can't receive spam from the world at large.


INTERNALS:

qregex (or regexmatch as the function is called) will be called during the
`helo/ehlo`, `rcpt to` and `mail from` handling routines in "qmail-smtpd.c".
When called, it will read the proper control file then one by one compile and
execute the regex on the string passed into qmail-smtpd. If the regex matches
it returns TRUE (1) and the qmail-smtpd process will deny the user the ability
to continue. If you change anything and think it betters this patch please
send me a new diff file so I can take a peek.
