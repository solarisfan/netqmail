= This patch puts together
* Erwin Hoffmann's qmail-authentication patch v. 0.8.3, which updates the patches provided by
  Krysztof Dabrowski and Bjoern Kalkbrenner.
  It provides cram-md5, login, plain authentication support for qmail-smtpd and qmail-remote.
  http://www.fehcom.de/qmail/smtpauth.html##PATCHES
* Frederik Vermeulen's qmail-tls patch v. 20200107
  implements SSL or TLS encrypted and authenticated SMTP.
  http://inoa.net/qmail-tls/
  The file update_tmprsadh was modified to chown all .pem files to vpopmail.
* Marcel Telka's force-tls patch v. 2016.05.15
  optionally gets qmail to require TLS before authentication to improve security.
  You have to declare FORCETLS=0 if you want to allow the auth without TLS
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/sites/notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/roberto-netqmail-1.06_force-tls.patch-2012.10.28
* Antonio Nati's chkuser patch v. 2.0.9
  performs, among the other things, a check for the existence of recipients during the SMTP conversation,
  bouncing emails of fake senders.
  http://www.interazioni.it/opensource/chkuser/
* Flavio Curti's qmail-queue-custom-error patch
  enables simscan and qmail-dkim to return the appropriate message for each e-mail it refuses to deliver.
  https://no-way.org/uploads/qmail-error/
* Christophe Saout's qmail-SPF rc5 patch
  Modified by Manvendra Bhangui to make it IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses compliant.
  checks incoming mails inside the SMTP daemon, add Received-SPF lines and optionally block undesired transfers.
  http://www.saout.de/misc/spf/
* Marcelo Coelho's qmail-SRS patch
  implements Sender Rewriting Scheme fixing SPF break upon email forwarding.
  http://www.mco2.com.br/opensource/qmail/srs/
* Christopher K. Davis' oversize dns patch
  enables qmail to handle large DNS packets.
  http://www.ckdhr.com/ckd/qmail-103.patch
* Jul's reread-concurrency v.2 patch
  rereads control/concurrencylocal and control/concurrencyremote files when qmail-send receives a HUP signal.
  http://js.hu/package/qmail/index.html
* Johannes Erdfelt's Big Concurrency patch
  sets the spawn limit above 255
  http://qmail.org/big-concurrency.patch

  is wrong (tx MG). More info here:
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/installing-dovecot-and-sieve-on-a-vpopmail-qmail-server-28.html#comment995
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/sites/notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/netqmail-maildir.patch
* Kyle B. Wheeler's "Better qmail-smtpd Logging" v.5 patch
  facilitates diagnostics of qmail-smtpd logging its actions and decisions (search for a line with qmail-smtp:)
  http://www.memoryhole.net/qmail/#logging
* John Simpson's (?) Greeting delay patch
  adds a user-definable delay after SMTP clients have initiated SMTP sessions, prior to qmail-smtpd responding
  with "220 ESMTP". It can reject connections from clients which tried to send commands before greeting.
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/sites/notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/qmail-greetdelay.patch
* Manvendra Bhangui's DKIM and SURBL filter v.1.26 patch
  adds DKIM signing & verification and SURBL filtering support to qmail.
  qmail-dk is based on Russ Nelson's patch: http//:www.qmail.org/qmail-1.03-dk-0.54.patch
  qmail-dkim uses hacked libdkim libraries from libdkim project at http://libdkim.sourceforge.net/
  surbfilter is built on djb functions and some functions have been ruthlessly borrowed from qmail surbl
  interface by Pieter Droogendijk and the surblhost program at http://surblhost.sourceforge.net/
  (file hier.c modified to chown /var/qmail/control/cache and subdirs to vpopmail)
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/indimail/files/netqmail-addons/qmail-dkim-1.0/
  http://notes.sagredo.eu/sites/notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/ANNOUNCE.surblfilter
* Claudio Jeker and Andre Oppermann's EXTTODO patch (release 5. Jan. 2003)
  addresses a problem known as the silly qmail (queue)  problem
  http://www.nrg4u.com/qmail/ext_todo-20030105.patch
* Russell Nelson's big-todo patch
  makes qmail use a hashing mechanism in the todo folder similar to that used in the rest of the queue
  http://www.qmail.org/big-todo.103.patch
* Stephane Cottin's qmail-inject-null-sender patch (let's call it in this way)
  prevents qmail-inject from rewriting the null sender, fixing an issue with sieve vacation/reject messages.
  More info here: http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2009-June/040811.html
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/qmail-inject-null-sender.patch
* Russell Nelson's (modified by Charles Cazabon) doublebounce-trim patch, which updates the original
  version by Russel Nelson
  prevents double bounces from hitting your queue a second time provided that you delete the first line
  from /var/qmail/control/doublebounceto
  http://qmail.org/doublebounce-trim.patch
* Will Harris' esmtp-size patch
  enables qmail-smtpd to reject messages if they're larger than the maximum number of bytes allowed
  according to the /var/qmail/control/databytes control file.
  http://will.harris.ch/qmail-smtpd.c.diff
* Inter7's qmail-taps-extended patch
  http://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/qmail-tap.diff
  Extended by Michai Secasiu (http://patchlog.com/patches/qmail-taps-extended/)
  Provides the ability to archive each email that flows through the system.
  Archiving only messages from or to certain email addresses is possible as well.
* Rolf Eike Beer's qmail-remote CRLF patch
  enables qmail-remote to handle CR properly, always sending the line breaks as CRLF and avoiding to
  double the CR (like qmail-remote normally does)
  http://opensource.sf-tec.de/qmail/
* Andy Repton's outgoingip patch (adjusted by Sergio Gelato)
  by default all outgoing emails are sent through the first IP address on the interface. In case of a multiple
  IP server this patch makes qmail send outgoing emails with the IP eventually stored in control/outgoingip.
  The ehlo domain is NOT modified by this patch.
  http://www.qmail.org/outgoingip.patch
  Robbie Walker provided a patch to correct qmail-qmqpc.c's call to timeoutconn(), because the function
  signature was modified by the original outgoingip patch
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/patching-qmail-82.html#comment373
* Iain Patterson's qmail-smtpd pid, qp log patch
  makes qmail-smtpd log a line similar to the following:
  @4000000039b89c95026a89b4 mail recv: pid 8155 from <name@domain.xy> qp 8157
  The pid allows you to match the message up with a given tcpserver process and the qp lets you find a
  particular delivery.
  http://iain.cx/qmail/patches.html#smtpd_pidqp
* Jonathan de Boyne Pollard's any-to-cname patch
  avoids qmail getting large amounts of DNS data we have no interest in and that may overflow our response
  buffer.
  http://www.memoryhole.net/qmail/#any-to-cname
* Matthias Andree's qmail-rfc2821 patch
  makes qmail rfc2821 compliant
  http://www-dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/~ma/qmail/patch-qmail-1.03-rfc2821.diff
* Jonathan de Boyne Pollard's smtpd-502-to-500 patch
  makes qmail rfc2821 compliant
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/smtpd-502-to-500.patch
* Fabio Busatto's qmail-dnsbl patch
  allows you to reject spam and virus looking at the sender's ip address.
  Modified by Luca Franceschini to add support for whitelists, TXT and A queries, configurable return codes
  451 or 553 with custom messages
  http://qmail-dnsbl.sourceforge.net/
* Scott Gifford's qmail-moreipme patch v. 0.6
  prevents a problem caused by an MX or other mail routing directive instructing qmail to connect to
  itself without realizing it's connecting to itself, saving CPU time.
  http://www.suspectclass.com/sgifford/qmail/qmail-1.03-moreipme.README
  http://www.suspectclass.com/sgifford/qmail/qmail-1.03-moreipme-0.6.patch
* Alex Nee's qmail-hide-ip-headers patch
  It will hide your Private or Public IP in the email Headers when you are sending Mail as a Relay Client.
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/qmail-hide-ip-headers.patch
* John Saunders' qmail-date-localtime patch
  causes the various qmail programs to generate date stamps in the local timezone.
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/qmail-date-localtime.patch
* Dean Gaudet's qmail-liberal-lf patch v. 0.95
  allow qmail-smtpd to accept messages that are terminated with a single \n instead of the required \r\n
  sequence.
  http://www.arctic.org/~dean/patches/qmail-0.95-liberal-lf.patch
* Michael Samuel's maxrcpt patch
  allows you to set a limit on how many recipients are specified for any one email message by setting
  control/maxrcpt. RFC 2821 section 4.5.3.1 says that an MTA MUST allow at least 100 recipients for each
  message, since this is one of the favourite tricks of the spammer.
  http://copilotco.com/mail-archives/qmail.1997/msg03066.html
* Inter7's qmail-eMPF patch
  More info: http://www.qmailwiki.org/EMPF
  eMPF follows a set of administrator-defined rules describing who can message whom.  With this,
  companies can segregate various parts of their organizations email activities, as well as provide a
  variety of security-enhancing services.
* qregex (by  Andrew St. Jean http://www.arda.homeunix.net/downloads-qmail/, contributors: Jeremy Kitchen,
  Alex Pleiner,
  Thanos Massias. Original patch by Evan Borgstrom)
  adds the ability to match address evelopes via Regular Expressions (REs) in the qmail-smtpd process.
  Added new control file 'badhelonorelay', control/badmailto renamed control/badrcptto (Tx Luca Franceschini).
* brtlimit
  Luca Franceschini derived this patch from http://netdevice.com/qmail/patch/goodrcptto-12.patch
  added control/brtlimit and BRTLIMIT variable to limit max invalid recipient errors before closing
  the connection (man qmail-control)
* validrcptto
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/validrcptto.README
  Luca Franceschini grabbed the code from several patches with additional features:
  http://qmail.jms1.net/patches/validrcptto cdb.shtml,
  http://netdevice.com/qmail/patch/goodrcptto-ms-12.patch, http://patch.be/qmail/badrcptto.html
  It works in conjunction with chkuser with both cdb and mysql accounts.
* reject-relay-test by Russell Nelson
  http://qmail.org/qmail-smtpd-relay-reject
  It gets qmail to reject relay probes generated by so-called anti-spammers. These relay probes have
  '!', '%' and '@' in the local (username) part of the address.
* Luca Franceschini
  added DISABLETLS environment variable, useful if you want to disable TLS on a desired port
  added FORCEAUTHMAILFROM environment variable to REQUIRE that authenticated user and 'mail from' are identical
  added SMTPAUTHMETHOD, SMTPAUTHUSER and SMTP_AUTH_USER env variables for external plugins (see
  http://qmail-spp.sourceforge.net/doc/)
* fixed little bug in 'mail from' address handling
  patch by Andre Opperman at http://qmail.cr.yp.narkive.com/kBry6GJl/bug-in-qmail-smtpd-c-addrparse-function
* Luca Franceschini's qlog patch
  smtpd logging with fixed format. An entry 'qlogenvelope' is generated after accepting or rejecting
  every recipients in the envelope phase.
* Luca Franceschini's reject null senders patch
  useful in special cases if you temporarily need to reject the null sender (although breaks RFC compatibility).
  You just need to put 1 (actually any number different from 0) in your control/rejectnullsenders to reject
  the null sender with 421 error message.
* dnscname patch
  Removes CNAME check in order to avoid getting large amounts of data of no interest in and that may
  overflow the response buffer.
  https://lists.gt.net/qmail/users/138190
* Luca Franceschini's rcptcheck patch
  (based on original patch from Jay Soffian (http://www.soffian.org/downloads/qmail/qmail-smtpd-doc.html)
  Originally designed for the purpose of receipt validation, it can also be used to limit the numbr of
  email a given IP and/or auth-user and/or domain can send in a given time interval. It has to be used
  in conjuction with the rcptcheck-overlimit.sh LF's script
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/rcptcheck-overlimit.sh
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/files/qmail/patches/rcptcheck.patch
* Reed Sandberg's qmail-channels patch
  Allows you to add an arbitrary number of supplemental remote queues, each distinguished by a list of
  recipient domains and separate throttling (concurrency) capabilities. This patch also allows dynamic
  throttling of the concurrency control files so you can just send qmail-send a HUP signal instead of
  restarting the service every time.
  This patch is useful when some email providers complain of too many emails receveid at the same time
  (in case of news letters for instance). Look here for more info
  https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/patching-qmail-82.html#comment1328
  Edit conf-channels before compiling: Total number of channels (queues) available for delivery. Must be at
  least 2, and anything above 2 are considered supplemental channels.
