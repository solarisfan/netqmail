I don't know what the sendmail config had wrong with it, but I know that
systems I've set up bounce the error just fine.  Check also in the mail
logs. 

qmail by default violates the "be liberal in what you accept" rule when
receiving mail via smtp.  It enforces strict \r\n behaviour... which is
exactly what the standard dictates.  But I'm not interested in my mailer
telling other admins to fix their setup, because I know they won't.  (The
straynewline() function tells people that if they're under Solaris they
need E=\r\n in their Mether mailer.) 

There is also bug in sendmail pre 8.8 that in some instances will emit
\rx\n for some printable x.  The case where it occured to me, the message
had been generated by a lame PC mail program.  In any event, this causes
qmail to indefinitely defer the incoming message. 

So instead I looked at the sendmail-8.8.4 code and tried to duplicate its
behaviour w.r.t. seeing \n when it wasn't expecting it.  That is what this
patch implements. 

Go ahead, shoot me.
